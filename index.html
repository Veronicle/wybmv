I tried sitting a little close to you. <br> I could not open my mouth, so I ended up playing that juggling game with a ball of paper <br> Do you remember the cop that came at the end? <br> After this, I went home and Sahendra told me that you liked me. <br> I was shocked. We went to Taco Bell right after (Vandan caught on with what was going on pretty quickly, haha). <br> I was very happy that day (can you tell by the video?!).
